# 0008 — Define E2E startup readiness as an exact log-marker contract

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-12

## Context

The unit-test layer deliberately never touches GTK
([ADR-0007](0007-pure-leaf-packages-route-around-untestable-gtk.md)), so one
end-to-end smoke test must prove the real application actually boots: GTK
initializes, the window is constructed and presented, dry-run mode engaged.
A GUI booted under CI has no user to observe it, and puregotk exposes no
convenient headless introspection hook — the only observable channel the
test controls is the process's stdout/stderr. "Started successfully" needs
a definition a test can poll.

## Decision

Startup readiness is a contract of three exact stdout markers, emitted by
`internal/app/app.go` and polled verbatim by the E2E test:

- `"Running in dry-run mode"` (`internal/app/app.go:83`)
- `"ChairLift activated"` (`internal/app/app.go:104`)
- `"app: window presented"` (`internal/app/app.go:118`; the test matches the
  line's fixed prefix)

`TestApplicationStartsInDryRun` (`test/e2e/e2e_test.go:60-169`) launches the
built binary with `--dry-run` under
`dbus-run-session -- test/e2e/wayland_session.sh`, a private headless Mutter
Wayland session, in a sanitized environment (`LANG=C`, `LC_ALL=C`,
`NO_AT_BRIDGE=1`, `GTK_A11Y=none`, `GSETTINGS_BACKEND=memory`,
`G_DEBUG=fatal-criticals`, `HOME=` a temp dir), polls combined output every
50ms for all three markers with a 30-second timeout, requires one further
second of stability (the process must not exit), then sends `SIGTERM` and
drains its private session.

The test binary location is a convention, not a search: `make e2e` builds
and exports `CHAIRLIFT_E2E_BUILD_DIR` (`Makefile:164-173`), and the test skips
with an explanatory message when the variable is unset
(`test/e2e/e2e_test.go:549-561`). The E2E package imports no puregotk
package and runs only via the explicit `make e2e` target, inside
`ghcr.io/projectbluefin/dakota:testing` (`test/e2e/dakota.sh`), outside the
`./internal/...` unit filter (core ADR-0022).

## Consequences

- The three log lines are a public API: renaming, rewording, or "tidying"
  any of them breaks CI until the test's `want` list is updated in the same
  change. That friction is the point — startup observability cannot decay
  silently.
- Readiness is defined by application-authored events, not by sleeps or
  window-system queries, so the test is fast when the app is fast and the
  30s ceiling only binds on genuine hangs.
- The sanitized environment plus a private D-Bus session and a private
  headless compositor keeps the test hermetic on shared runners (no session
  bus leakage, no a11y bus attempts, no user dconf writes, no live display).
- Anyone adding a startup phase that can hang should add a marker for it and
  extend the contract, rather than relying on the stability window.

## Alternatives considered

- **Fixed sleep then "process still alive" check:** rejected — proves only
  that the process did not crash, not that a window was presented; and it is
  slow on fast hosts, flaky on slow ones.
- **Window-system introspection (compositor queries/AT-SPI):** rejected —
  a11y is deliberately disabled for hermeticity, and compositor-level queries
  assert less than the app's own "window presented" event while being far
  more fragile.
- **A dedicated readiness IPC (file/socket/D-Bus signal):** rejected —
  production code would grow a test-only channel; the log lines already
  exist for humans and cost nothing to keep exact.
