# Leaf-package doc prose must enumerate every distinct outcome it covers, not summarize with "every"/"all"

**When it applies:** Writing or reviewing the `docs/design/overview.md` /
`docs/design/package-managers.md` (formerly `yeti/`) prose that describes
what a new puregotk-free leaf
package's exported functions decide (following the
`flatpakstatus`/`featurestatus`/`actionmsg` pattern from
`docs/agents/skills/gtk-headless-tests.md`), when that package has more than
one distinct branch or outcome — success/zero/failure, singular/plural,
expandable/not.

**What to do:** Name each outcome and which exported function produces it,
rather than compressing them into a vague summary phrase like "handles every
outcome" or "covers all cases." A reviewer checks this prose against the
package's actual branches and rejects a summary that could be true of a
package that silently drops a case. Also state explicitly, if true, that the
call site composes no subtitle/description text of its own — that claim is
what proves the leaf package, not the view, owns the decision. Write the
sentence as a small enumeration (e.g. "`GroupDescriptionCheckFailed` when the
check itself failed, and `GroupDescription` when it completed with zero
features updatable or with updates found") instead of one abstract adjective.

**Learned from:** issue #67's mill run, chunk 1 review — the
`yeti/OVERVIEW.md` sentence for the new `internal/views/featurestatus`
package said only that `checkFeatureUpdates` applies it "on every outcome,"
without naming the failure/zero/found branches or stating the view composes
no text of its own. The reviewer flagged it (medium) as insufficient; the
sweep fixed it by spelling out each outcome and its producing function.
