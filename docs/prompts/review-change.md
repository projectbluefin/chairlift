Review [BRANCH, COMMIT, OR DIFF] for correctness and regressions in ChairLift.

Read AGENTS.md, docs/SKILL.md, and the matching package from docs/skills/
first. Inspect surrounding code and tests, not only the diff. Prioritize
findings over summary.

Check specifically for:
- privileged mutations bypassing the fixed pkexec helper and PolicyKit policy;
- external commands or widget updates running on the wrong thread;
- stale async workers replacing newer state;
- disabled configuration groups leaving nil widgets that later code dereferences;
- package actions losing known rows/counts on failure or dry-run;
- navigation, page visibility, and shortcut inventories drifting apart;
- tests skipped by the repository's TestI/Integration CI name filter;
- current-state documentation contradicting source, config, go.mod, or install files.

For each finding, give the file and line, explain the concrete failure mode, and suggest the smallest safe correction. Distinguish blocking defects from optional improvements. If there are no findings, say so and identify any testing gap that still limits confidence.
```
