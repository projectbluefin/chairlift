// Package featurestatus turns the outcome of an updex feature update check —
// the per-component [updex.CheckResult] slice for one feature, and the totals
// across all features — into the text the Features page shows: a feature row's
// subtitle plus whether that feature has an update, and the features group's
// description.
//
// A feature has an update when ANY of its components reports one — not the
// first component, not all of them. Status.HasUpdate is therefore an OR across
// every element of the results slice, and both halves of the answer come from
// the single Feature call so the subtitle and the update decision cannot drift
// apart (the same reason flatpakstatus.Subtitle returns a Result struct).
//
// The update count in the group description is a count of FEATURES, not of
// components: a feature with three outdated components counts once. The
// sentence's first number is a feature count, so its second number must be one
// too or the sentence is incoherent.
//
// The package is separate from internal/views because internal/views can never
// host a _test.go: the Go GTK bindings it imports (puregotk) dlopen the GTK,
// Libadwaita, GLib and graphene shared libraries at package-init time, so a
// test binary for any package that imports them panics before a single test
// function runs. Decidable logic must live in a binding-free package to be
// testable at all, which is the same reason internal/views/actionmsg,
// internal/views/trustmsg, internal/views/rowset and
// internal/views/flatpakstatus are separate. See
// docs/agents/skills/gtk-headless-tests.md. Importing internal/updex for the
// CheckResult type is safe here because internal/updex is itself puregotk-free
// (`go list -deps ./internal/updex | grep -c puregotk` prints 0).
//
// The package is pure and holds no state, so it is safe to call from a worker
// goroutine or from inside an sgtk.RunOnMainThread closure.
