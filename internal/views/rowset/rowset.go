// Package rowset holds the clear-then-repopulate bookkeeping for rows a view
// adds to an expander, so a list that is reloaded never accumulates stale rows
// from a previous load.
//
// It is deliberately free of any puregotk/GTK import — in fact it imports
// nothing outside the standard library — so its logic can be unit-tested on a
// headless host. A test binary for a package that imports puregotk panics while
// resolving GTK/graphene shared libraries at package init, before any test
// function runs, so logic that must be tested cannot live in the view packages.
// See docs/agents/skills/gtk-headless-tests.md.
//
// The tracker never names a widget type: it is generic over a comparable row
// type, and removal is performed by a caller-supplied callback, which is what
// keeps the package dependency-free.

// removed again before the container is repopulated.

// the clear-and-repopulate sequence inside a single main-thread closure.
