// Package flatpakstatus turns the outcome of the two Flatpak update queries —
// how many updates are known, and which of the user/system installations could
// not be checked — into the text of the Flatpak updates expander's subtitle and
// whether that expander should be expandable.
//
// It is deliberately free of any GTK binding import — in fact it imports
// nothing outside the standard library — so its logic can be unit-tested on a
// headless host. internal/views cannot host this logic: the Go GTK bindings it
// imports dlopen the GTK, Libadwaita, GLib and graphene shared libraries at
// package-init time, so a test binary for any package that imports them panics
// before a single test function runs. Decidable logic must therefore live in a
// binding-free package to be testable, which is the same reason
// internal/views/actionmsg, internal/views/trustmsg and internal/views/rowset
// are separate. See docs/agents/skills/gtk-headless-tests.md.
//
// The package is pure and holds no state: it takes booleans rather than error
// values (which would drag in internal/flatpak) and returns a value, so it is
// safe to call from a worker goroutine or from inside an
// sgtk.RunOnMainThread closure.

// queries succeeded and found nothing.

// Authoritative is false when both queries failed: a load that learned nothing
// must not be allowed to publish an empty inventory over a known one.
